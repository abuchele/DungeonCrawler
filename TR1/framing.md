Technical Review 1: Project Orpheus
Dungeon Crawler: Preparation and Framing

Background and Context
Project headline: Dungeon Crawler
The MVP for our final project is a simple roguelike game in which the player must explore a series of underground regions in order to save a friend. The adventure will be based on Greek Mythology. We also plan on implementing side-quests, NPCs, combat, stealth, fog of war, bosses, and a save system.
Max and Leon worked on a dungeon crawler in the last project, so we are iterating on that and making it into a real game. We will include several different levels and terrains, as well as combat systems and a variety of monsters and bosses. We also hope to include background music, sprites, and side-quests.

Key questions
- What do you think of our game ideas? 
- Is there anything weâ€™re doing or planning on doing that is obviously a bad idea?
- What combat system should we use? 
- Should the game be in real-time, or turn-based?
- Is our story compelling?
- Which dungeon generation algorithms do you like best?

Agenda
- Introduction, background and explanation of our game ideas and story (5 minutes)
- Show-and-tell of what we have so far (12 minutes)
- Explanation of our questions, and receiving advice (8 minutes)
