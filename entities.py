To-do:

Sprites for different entities


Notes:

Removed need for global variables. Now initializing player requires x, y, and grid, and each monster needs x, y, player and grid.
It's a bit more of a pain to initialize (more variables required) but we can change stuff and feed it in, instead of them grabbing the global 
    value for 'player' and 'grid'.

"""Changes:"""

# added 'effect' -> basically, being poisoned or something. It's a dictionary, with True or False for whether the effect is active. We can add in what the effect actually does eventually. 
# also added the action of being effected, and can call Entity.active_effects() to get a list of all active effects. 

# added in items, and made it so items can be added to the inventory and used, along with some fun text descriptions for their appearence and usage.
# made potion class, for easy potion making (writing all those descriptions is a pain, this way you just have to put what they do)

# also added max health, so that when the player uses potions they can't go past their max health. 

# ex: Anna.effected('poisoned') -> "You've been poisoned!" -> Anna.effect['poisoned'] = True -> Anna.active_effects = ['poisoned'] -> cure_potion = Potion('cure','poisoned') 
# 	  cure_potion.pickup(Anna) -> (fun flair text) -> Anna.inventory = {'Weird Blue Potion' , 1} -> cure_potion.use(Anna) -> (fun cured flair text) -> Anna.active_effects = []
