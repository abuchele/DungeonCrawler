DungeonCrawler

You wake up in a dark stone room. You can't remember who you are or where you came from. All you know is that you're here to save a friend. You stand and examine the dimly-lit room. It looks like a dungeon. And the doors are pretty low. Looks like you'll have to become a Dungeon Crawler!

### Install and Play:  
  Start by downloading the github repository. Once you open it, you will have two options to play.
  
  For best results, you will need pygame, pickle, and Python 2.7 to play this game. If you do not have pygame or pickle, use  
  `$ sudo apt-get install pygame pickle`  
  If you don't have Python 2.7, go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download it.  
  Once everything is installed, simply direct yourself to the directory of the repository and run `driver.py` using Python or BASH.  
  Ex:  
    `$ cd ~/Downloads/DungeonCrawler-master`  
    `$ python driver.py`
  
  Alternatively, you can open the `DungeonCrawlerCompiled.zip` archive and run the `\_ADungeonCrawler\_` executable. It will be slightly more taxing on your CPU, but you won't need to install anything.
  
### Controls:   
  When you start the game it will prompt you to continue from where you left off or start over. Respond by simply pressing 'y' or 'n'. If it is your first time playing, press 'n'.
  
  Once you enter the game, controls are as follows:  
  W - Move up
  A - Move left
  S - Move down
  D - Move right
  E - Interact
  R - Attack
  TAB - Equip next song
  LSHIFT - Equip previous song
  ESC - Pause
  G - Fire gun (you only have one bullet; use it wisely)
