DungeonCrawler
=======  
You wake up in a dark stone room. A turbid river runs through the center of it. You can't remember who you are or where you came from. All you know is that you're here to save a friend. You turn on your flashlight, but it flickers out immediately. Soaked. You stand and examine the dimly-lit room. It looks like a dungeon. And the doors are pretty low. Looks like you'll have to become a Dungeon Crawler [TODO: Think of a better name]!
