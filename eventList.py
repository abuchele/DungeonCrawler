		"""So basically, the player starts off the game talking to Mr.E, dialogue 0001.  Then after the
		player talks to Mr.E and enters their name, Player_named is set to true.  This allows Mr.E to 
		go to the next dialogue, 0002.  If the player attempts to leave before finishing dialogue 4, 
		Mr.E will play Dialogue 0003.  After Dialogue 0004 is finished, the player can go outside
		to kill monsters.  Once it is true, it triggers Dialogue 005.  Once dialogue 5 is finished, 
		The player can trigger dialogue 6.  Once that is finished, the player can go outside.  
		Once the player kills enough monsters, the quest will be finished.  If this is true, then 
		Mr. E will have dialogue 0007, and then mark the quest confirm as true."""
